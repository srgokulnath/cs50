const x = 42
console.log(typeof x)

//Type casting in explicit and implicit way
const explicit = String(x)             //"42"
const implicit = x + ""             //"42"


console.log(typeof null)   //ans is "object"
//work of console.log is to change whatever is there inside in to a string and return it, so it does not necessarily mean that the type
// is string bcoz it returns a string


//falsy:                                                 truthy:
//undefined,null,false,zero                                      {},[],everything else is truthy (wht the fuck r those)
